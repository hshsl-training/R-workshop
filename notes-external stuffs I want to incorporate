external stuffs I want to incorporate

- a knitted pdf of our code exercizes
- a pdf of the handout
- an excel file that gets saved as csv and then read into R
  - then look at the `xlsx` package and the `foreign` package which reads SPSS, SAS, and Stata files

- browse a package manual to find how to use it
- write a file
